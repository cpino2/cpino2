This semester, I am learning how to build up my GitHub porfolio, embarking on fun passion projects using my coding skills on Visual Studio Code, and understanding the connections between Visual Studio Code and my Github Desktop!

## Accomplishments‚ö°
As I reflect on all that I've learned this semester, here are some goals I've met that I am proud of myself for accomplishing! 
- Pursuing a passion project through the creation of the Alzhemier's Disease Risk Predictor App
- Creating a Streamlit App using spaCy's NER
- Keeping an organized Python Portfolio
- Learning how to deploy an app on the Streamlit Community Cloud
- Applying interactive lines of code to engage the user with apps created
- Commenting out all lines of code to explain the function of each command
- Keeping my portfolio updated as new projects are created and old ones are revised

## Goals‚ö°
- Create disease risk predictor apps for other conditions, such as COVID-19 and ALS
- Analyze larger datasets from the National Institute of Health using Data Visualization Skills
- Create App For Notre Dame Athletes to Receive Feedback for Perfomance Enhancment and Injury Risk Prevention through Sports Biomechanics Research Group in the College of Engineering
- Sharing my creations/projects with others in the healthcare domain through the Streamlit Community Cloud
